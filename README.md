# Pareto front identification experiments
This repository contains the programs used for the experiments in the
article *Sequential Learning of the Pareto Front for Multiple-objective Bandits*
by *élise crepon, Aurélien Garivier and Wouter M. Koolen*.

To run the experiments, start by creating a virtual environment and activating it
```bash
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
```

Then you can download within the virtual environment the necessary packages
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
